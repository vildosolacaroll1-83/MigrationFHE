# MigrationFHE

MigrationFHE is a confidential computation framework that enables multiple national statistical agencies to jointly analyze encrypted global migration data using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). It allows for collaborative study of migration patterns, population flows, and cross-border dynamics — without exposing any individual or country-level sensitive information. All analytical operations, including aggregation, trend modeling, and prediction, are performed directly over encrypted data.

## Overview

Migration patterns are among the most politically and socially sensitive datasets in the world.  
Traditional international data collaborations are constrained by strict privacy regulations, sovereignty issues, and the risk of exposing individual records. Even anonymized data often carries re-identification risks when combined with other public datasets.

MigrationFHE introduces a **privacy-by-design collaboration framework** where data never leaves its country of origin in plaintext form. Each participating institution encrypts its migration datasets under a shared FHE scheme, and joint analyses are executed across encrypted datasets. The results — global migration flows, prediction models, and policy insights — are obtained without any party seeing the raw data of others.

In short: MigrationFHE enables *global cooperation without global exposure*.

## Motivation

### The Challenge
- International migration data contains detailed personal records such as origin, destination, age, and occupation.  
- Aggregating across nations is crucial for understanding labor markets, refugee movements, and demographic trends.  
- But direct data sharing violates privacy laws and often sparks political and ethical concerns.  

### The Opportunity
With FHE, it becomes possible to:
- Compute global migration trends while keeping every country’s dataset encrypted.  
- Build predictive models across borders without any data exchange in plaintext.  
- Preserve data sovereignty and individual confidentiality simultaneously.  

MigrationFHE turns previously impossible international data collaboration into a secure, cryptographically verifiable process.

## Key Features

### 1. Encrypted Cross-National Analytics
Each participating country uploads its encrypted migration dataset to the shared computational space.  
All analytical operations — including aggregation, correlation, and clustering — are executed over ciphertexts using FHE arithmetic.

### 2. Global Flow Modeling
The system constructs a global migration graph where nodes represent countries or regions, and weighted edges (migration flows) are computed homomorphically.  
Analysts can query total inflows, outflows, and network centrality metrics without ever decrypting intermediate data.

### 3. Predictive Forecasting under Encryption
Machine learning models, such as encrypted linear regression or neural approximations, are trained on encrypted features (e.g., population, employment rate, migration pressure indicators) to forecast future migration trends.

### 4. Secure Multi-Party Participation
No centralized data repository exists. Instead, computations are orchestrated through distributed FHE protocols that maintain correctness while preventing any participant from accessing another’s raw data.

### 5. Policy-Ready Outputs
After encrypted computation, only the final authorized results — such as aggregate migration matrices or regional trend summaries — are decrypted for public policy use.

## Why FHE Matters

FHE is the foundation of MigrationFHE. It transforms the very way global data collaboration works.

- **Computation without exposure:** FHE allows mathematical operations on encrypted values, so countries can jointly compute migration statistics without ever decrypting data.  
- **Verifiable integrity:** Each computation step is cryptographically valid, ensuring no tampering or bias.  
- **Compliance by design:** Since plaintext never crosses borders, the framework aligns with privacy regulations like GDPR and national data protection laws.  
- **Scalable trust model:** Participating agencies no longer need to trust each other — only the math.  

Without FHE, true global-scale, privacy-preserving migration analysis would be impossible.

## Architecture

### System Components

1. **Data Providers (National Agencies)**  
   - Encrypt local migration datasets using a shared FHE key scheme.  
   - Maintain full control of their data — it never leaves their infrastructure unencrypted.  

2. **FHE Computation Nodes**  
   - Execute homomorphic operations such as sum, mean, and vector multiplication across ciphertext datasets.  
   - Hosted in neutral or distributed environments.  

3. **Aggregation Engine**  
   - Builds encrypted migration flow matrices across participating regions.  
   - Supports hierarchical aggregation (city → country → region → global).  

4. **Model Evaluation Module**  
   - Applies encrypted regression or clustering to identify patterns.  
   - Produces statistical indicators like net migration rate, return flows, or urbanization trends.  

5. **Result Decryption Authority**  
   - A multi-party controlled entity responsible for decrypting only final, authorized outputs.  
   - Ensures that no intermediate data or partial computations are ever revealed.

## Analytical Capabilities

MigrationFHE supports a rich set of encrypted analytics:

- **Homomorphic Aggregation:** Summation of encrypted migration counts by age, gender, and region.  
- **Encrypted Correlation:** Detecting relationships between migration and economic indicators.  
- **Temporal Trend Analysis:** Comparing encrypted yearly flows to identify emerging trends.  
- **Forecast Modeling:** Encrypted regression predicting migration probabilities over time.  
- **Network Visualization:** Global flow patterns derived from encrypted adjacency matrices.  

Every computation remains encrypted end-to-end.

## Example Workflow

1. Each national agency prepares its dataset (e.g., migration inflows/outflows, demographic attributes).  
2. The data is encrypted locally using the shared FHE key.  
3. Encrypted datasets are submitted to the computation environment.  
4. Aggregations and analyses are performed homomorphically.  
5. Only the authorized final results (e.g., total global migration rate, predictive model coefficients) are decrypted.  

At no point are any individual or regional-level plaintext data exposed.

## Security Design

MigrationFHE employs a **multi-layer confidentiality model**:

- **Homomorphic Protection:** All computations are executed in ciphertext space.  
- **Data Sovereignty Preservation:** Raw data never leaves national boundaries in plaintext.  
- **Multi-Party Decryption Control:** Decryption rights distributed among participants.  
- **Zero Trust Framework:** Collaboration does not depend on mutual trust between agencies.  
- **Auditability:** Every operation is cryptographically verifiable and recorded for integrity assurance.  

Even if a computation node is compromised, the attacker gains no usable information.
